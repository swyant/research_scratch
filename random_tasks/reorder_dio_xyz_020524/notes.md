Took the extXYZ, made a vim macro where I searched for "lattice", searched for "O ", deleted that line, searched for "lattice", hit capital N, went down two lines, and inserted the O line, so that it was always in the second position.

Then in ovito, I did an affine translation to center the O interstitial in the box, and replicated the atoms sufficicently. I then manually deleted the excess, selected the O interestitial, and generated the trajectory lines
